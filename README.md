# Generative Shapes System

## Description
Generative Shapes System is a creative coding project designed to produce intricate and unique geometric designs. Utilizing a grid-based approach, this p5.js-powered system generates a variety of shapes based on algorithmic rules and randomization, resulting in SVG outputs that can be appreciated as art pieces or used in other design applications.

## Features
- **Grid-Based Layout**: A customizable grid that supports varying numbers of columns and rows.
- **Dynamic Shape Generation**: Algorithm-driven shapes that ensure a wide range of aesthetics.
- **Color Palette Selection**: Randomized color palette assignment for vibrant visual outputs.
- **SVG Export**: Easily save generated designs as SVG files for further use.

## Setup
To get started with the Generative Shapes System, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `https://github.com/yazan-metax/generative_geo_shapes.git`.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the system in action.
3. Adjust `grid` and `color` settings in `setup()` within `sketch.js` to modify the output.

## Configuration
Modify the following configurations in the `setup()` function to personalize your generative art:
- `grid.boxSize`: Determines the size of the grid cells.
- `grid.columns`: The number of columns in the grid.
- `grid.rows`: The number of rows in the grid.
- `color_pal1`, `color_pal2`, `color_pal3`: Define these arrays with your preferred color schemes.

## Usage
Interact with the system through the user interface to generate new shapes or export the current design as an SVG:
- **Generate**: simply press on the 'r' letter on your keyboard.
- **Save SVG**: simply press on the 's' letter on the keyboard.

## Technologies
This project is implemented using the following technologies:
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/): A client-side library for creating graphic and interactive experiences.
- [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG): An XML-based markup language for describing two-dimensional vector graphics.
